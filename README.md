# codeQuiz
This project was created to fulfill the requirements of Turing School. This is the final project of the first half of Turing.

## About
This app was designed to be a learning tool for coders. The idea is that the dataset of questions could expand to hold any number of categories, and those questions would be compiled together for review. Questions a user misses can be reviewed when the site is visited again, using local storage.

## Learning Goals
This is my first solo project in React. Previously, we have worked in groups of three. For this project, I took what I had learned with a group and applied the concepts of React to create an interactive learning app. I solidified my knowledge of components, props, and passing data down, bringing action data back up. We also used a fetch call to gather our data hosted externally, so we practiced handling that sort of asynchronous request.



### React specs
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
