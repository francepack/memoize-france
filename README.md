# codeQuiz
Test your coding knowledge! This React project was built as the final project of the first half of Turing School.

## About
We were challenged to build a learning tool for coders. My idea was to use React to handle an expandable amount of questions and categories. We were also to store missed questions locally for review by the user.

## Learning Goals
This is my first solo project in React, having built one previous app with a group of 3. While making this app, I solidified my knowledge of components, props, and passing data down, bringing action data back up. A fetch call is used to gather data from an external host, which was another learning goal for this project.
