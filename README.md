# codeQuiz
Learning to code can be a daunting taks- there are so many subjects to practice, such as vocabularly, concepts, syntax... the list goes on! This application is designed to accept a scalable set of review questions and deliver them to a user separated by category. A user can track their progress in each category, as well as revisit any questions they may have missed. 

This project was created to fulfill the requirements of completing the first half of Turing School. It was build with React.

## Learning Goals
This was the first project I had completed by myself using React. I took what I had learned from my previous group project and applied the concepts of React to create an interactive learning application. I solidified my knowledge of components, props, and passing data down, bringing action data back up. We also used a fetch call to gather our data hosted externally, so we practiced ajax requests.
