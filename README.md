## Learning Goals
This is my first solo project in React, having built one previous app with a group of 3. I was challenged to build a learning tool for coders using React where missed questions are stored locally for review by the user. I wanted to use React components dynamically to be able to handle a varying amount of questions and categories. While making this app, I solidified my knowledge of components, props, and data down, actions up. Using a fetch call to gather data from an external host was another learning goal for this project.
